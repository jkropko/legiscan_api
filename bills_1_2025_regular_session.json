A father required to pay for expenses pursuant to subsection may petition the circuit court for relief from those requirements, provided that the father agrees to undergo a vasectomy. A man required to undergo a vasectomy under this subsection must provide the court with documentation of the vasectomy. If a man required to pay for expenses pursuant to subsection disputes that he is the father of the unborn child in question, he may petition the circuit court to adjudicate paternity.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA: Section. The Legislature finds and declares the following:  During the Battle of Baltimore of the War of, Francis Scott Key visited the British fleet in the Chesapeake                             SB INTRODUCED Francis Scott Key visited the British fleet in the Chesapeake Bay on September,, to secure the release of Dr. William Beanes, who had been captured after the British burned Washington, D.C.  The release of Dr. Beanes was secured, but Key and Beanes were held by the British during the shelling of Fort McHenry, one of the forts defending Baltimore.  On the morning of September,, after the -hour British bombardment of Fort McHenry, Key peered through the clearing smoke to see a -foot by -foot American flag flying proudly atop the Fort.  He was so inspired to see the enormous flag still flying over the Fort that he began penning a song, which he named The Defence of Fort McHenry, to commemorate the occasion, and he included a note that it should be sung to the tune of the popular British melody To Anacreon in Heaven.  In, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that the anthem, which had been popularly renamed The Star-Spangled Banner, be played at military and naval occasions.  On March,, President Herbert Hoover signed a resolution of Congress that officially designated The Star-Spangled Banner as the National Anthem of the United States.  For over  years, The Star-Spangled Banner has served to inspire generations of patriotic Americans, and it is imperative that students have exposure to this history and inspiration. Section.
